Using ESLint with IntelliJ originally was painful to get used to. However, as I got more used to it, I think that getting used to using it was greatly beneficial to me, as it made my code cleaner and more concise. I think that implementing universal coding standards can aid people in learning new programming languages. Having concrete guidelines that all programmers follow would make code more readable between different editors. This means that code can be more efficiently utilized between different people. It also helps prevent errors on the screen before the code is compiled. I don’t believe that it is necessary to write good, clean code, but it can be useful when utilized. Primarily, I believe it helps with code consistency, but if a programmer is already experienced and follows good coding practices, it may not be as useful for them. I think it is also good that ESLint integrates into IDE’s as well. This is good because since multiple code editors can be used with ESLint, people used to coding on different types of IDEs can efficiently use it as well. The customization of ESLint also allows for the programmers to deem what is necessary and what is not. It allows for flexibility in error handling in the code. The ability to enable and disable certain options and rules can allow the code to be as restrictive or open as needed.

	For me specifically, I think that it had a hard learning curve to get used to, but as I learned how to use it, it became very useful for me. Originally, I very much disliked using ESLint because I found that a lot of what it throws is pointless, but I started to recognize how to use it more as I used it throughout the week. It primarily helped me catch errors before compiling the code, which saved me a lot of time in the long run. Since I was never good at catching my syntax errors, it really helped me with that. My code before using ESLint was also ugly to look at. With ESLint in mind, I made sure to keep consistency in mind when writing my code. Overall, I would say that ESLint helped me with my coding efficiency. I think that it will help me keep cleanliness in my code in mind when coding in the future, even when coding without ESLint.
