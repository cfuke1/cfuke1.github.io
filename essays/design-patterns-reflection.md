## What are Design Patterns? 

In my opinion, design patterns in code are similar to using keyboard shortcuts. They are easily replicable, and they make coding much more convenient. They expedite the process of working on code just like how keyboard shortcuts expedite working on documents. Design patterns allow for code that would have to be typed out multiple times to be types just once and called multiple times. This is mostly commonly seen in methods and functions in code to allow easy replication of code in multiple places. Design patterns also allow for better consistency to be used in code. An example of this would be objects and classes. Creating objects and components in code and accurately describing how they work is helpful for keeping consistency in coding, because it makes sure they’re organized. This organization also lets multiple people work on the same code without it being overly difficult to understand. If multiple people can understand how one object works, they can understand how they all work. This is similar to if multiple people were working on a spreadsheet, if they all understood how to make use of certain keyboard shortcuts, they could all work with much greater efficiency than if they didn’t. The consistent code allows for programmers to create a solid foundation for which their code is built upon. One more aspect of design patterns is their communicability. Design patterns allow for code to be more easily understood, which means that they can be more easily explained from developer to developer. This mirrors key shortcuts, because it is very easy to explain them to new people. Explaining copy and paste shortcuts to others is very easy, and massively improves efficiency when working on a document or spreadsheet. Design patterns like methods are very similar and can be easily explained as well.

What are Null Pointer Exceptions (java.lang.NullPointerException) and what causes them?

What methods/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop the exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?

## How do I use Design Patterns? 

These questions are clear and concise, and also use proper grammar and spelling. It is obvious what the writer of the question is asking for, and it shows in the feedback that the question is given. There are 12 answers to this question on StackOverflow, providing the writer with more than enough information to find out what the Null Pointer Exception is, and how to avoid them. The question also follows many of the principles Eric Raymond emphasizes. It is easy to reply to, and written in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language. It also is explicit and precise about the problem the question is asking. This allowed the question being asked to be given a numerous amount of concise and clear responses. This question is a demonstration of good communication from a developer. Although the question is basic, and there are other easier ways of obtaining the answer to this question, because it follows what I believe to be the most important principles Raymond portrays, it is a good question to be asked. An example of a bad question is this.

```
I currently have a Sum Filter Formula that looks like the following:

=IFERROR(SUM(FILTER({$U$5:U;$W$5:W;$Y$5:Y;$AA$5:AA;$AC$5:AC;$AE$5:AE;$AG$5:AG;$AI$5:AI;$AK$5:AK;$AM$5:AM;$AO$5:AO;$AQ$5:AQ;$AS$5:AS;$AU$5:AU;$AW$5:AW;$AY$5:AY;$BA$5:BA;$BC$5:BC;$BE$5:BE;$BG$5:BG},{$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M}=true,{$T$5:T;$V$5:V;$X$5:X;$Z$5:Z;$AB$5:AB;$AD$5:AD;$AF$5:AF;$AH$5:AH;$AJ$5:AJ;$AL$5:AL;$AN$5:AN;$AP$5:AP;$AR$5:AR;$AT$5:AT;$AV$5:AV;$AX$5:AX;$AZ$5:AZ;$BB$5:BB;$BD$5:BD;$BF$5:BF}=B5)),0)

Very gross I know, but I wanted to know if there was an easier way of writing this as it is very annoying to replicate for future uses and change when required.

Cheers in advance

This question violates many of the principles that Eric Raymond emphasizes. The question is hard to answer because it is very hard to look at and decipher. It is effectively just a big block of code. The text below also is very vague in what the writer is asking for. This violates many of Eric Raymond’s principles of a good question, some of which are being sent in a clear, standard format, making it easy to reply to, and being precise and informative about the problem. Aesthetically, the question is hard to look at, so people are also less inclined to give answers to it. This shows, as the question is downvoted on StackExchange, and has no answers. 

## Conclusion

Eric Raymond’s principles surrounding a question’s wording and precision are primarily responsible for making it a good question or not. The content of the question still does matter, but less than what makes it digestible for the reader. People are not required to give answers to these questions on websites like StackOverflow and StackExchange, so it is important to word questions in a way that is pleasant to look at. This means that large, hard to follow segments of code should be off limits if you want to write a good question. Vague and confusing wording should be avoided as well. Overall, you should be aiming to write a question that you would be willing to answer yourself if given the chance.
