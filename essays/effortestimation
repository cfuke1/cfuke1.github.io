Over the course of the ICS 314 Final Project, effort estimation made me a better coder due to two main things. Firstly, estimating my efforts let me ensure that I can manage time effectively. This let me better utilize the time that I had to work on the project. Predicting time was not always easy for me, but I was able to predict roughly however much time tasks would take. Something I noticed was that I would run into roadblocks with some features, causing me to massively underestimate the time needed to complete them. Even though this happened multiple times, I still found the estimates to be generally accurate, and I improved on my estimation skills over the course of the projectâ€™s lifespan. Later in the project, I also tended to overestimate rather than underestimate my predicted times. I think that this was a good thing, as it made sure that my estimations would never cause me to work longer than I thought. This ensured that I would not end up in a time crunch if I planned my times correctly. 

Another benefit of effort estimation is that it improved my organizational and time management skills as a whole. Making sure that I kept track of time made it easier for me to predict times in the future. Also, creating time estimates allowed me to fit project work into my schedule, which was convenient for me, and also reinforced organization in my schedule. In the beginning, recording my time also made me come to the realization that I was spending a lot more time than predicted on features. This allowed me to gain a more realistic expectation of my time management throughout the project, and also with other assignments not related to the project. This indirectly helped me manage my time better
