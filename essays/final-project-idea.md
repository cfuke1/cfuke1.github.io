Title: Calendar Tracker
<br>
Author: Colby Fuke
<br><br>

A problem nowadays with students is that they are always busy with events and can never find time to plan things with each other. Many students need to constantly check with each other’s schedules to hang with friends, and a lot of events that students are unaware of can pop up and interfere with plans. This is why I would like to make a calendar tracker app. This would be an app that allows students to display their schedules to friends online. It would allow multiple students to view each others’ schedules at once, and automatically find times where everyone has free time. 
<br><br>
The mockup page would have a button to access all students and their friends’ schedules, a button to add and delete events from a students’ personal schedule, and a groups button, which would allow students to create groups with their friends. When viewing all students’ schedules, another button would be available to find the best synchronized free time for students within customizable time parameters. On the personal schedule page, students would be able to add and delete events, and mark events as public or private, letting them keep certain things private from their friends. The groups page would allow students to find their friends by name or student ID, and would allow them to send requests to join a group.

For use cases, the app could be used on a large scale like in student clubs. This would allow clubs to find the best times for students to attend club meetings or club events. Professors could also require students to use the app, and schedule their office hours or extracurricular activities to best fit the times that students are available. On a small scale, this app could be used in small friend groups, to study or to find time to hang out with friends. The app would also not be limited to just students. Many people would be able to benefit from having a publicly visible schedule, and I think that it could help a lot of people to find time to be with their friends. One potential problem with this app is that it could facilitate stalking between users. I intend to add a blocking feature to make sure that this does not happen, and that schedules are only shared between people who trust each other.
