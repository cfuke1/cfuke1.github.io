JavaScript Reflection
  So far, I have found Javascript to be easier than the other languages I have learned. This may be because I already have prerequisite knowledge of coding though. I think that it’s similarity with Java is that it made it easier to use because I feel that I know Java the most of all languages I've used. Regardless, there were still things I didn’t know. A lot of ES6 exercises were difficult for me. Comparing scopes, destructuring, and exporting files was difficult, because they were more advanced than what I was used to. I also learned new concepts, such as promises, mutating arrays, and creating a module script. I enjoy object-oriented programming, so I enjoyed using javascript. Since my classes last semester didn’t have much to do with coding, I enjoyed the programming practice WODs in this class. 
  To me, Javascript seems like a good first language for beginners to learn because it seems simple to use, and easy to understand. When I worked with C keeping track of data outside of just the code was difficult to keep track of. Also, in my opinion, object-oriented programming is one of the easier styles of coding to learn, because grasping the concepts of objects seems fairly easy to understand. It is what I am most familiar with, so transitioning to Javascript was pretty easy for me. I think that since Javascript is popular, a lot of resources are online for beginners to learn. 
I think from a software engineering perspective, Javascript is a good language to use. This is because it is very versatile, and can be used on multiple platforms easily. Using classes and functions allows code to be easily reusable. This is important because when certain calls are needed multiple times, it is easy to edit the code in a space efficient way. I think that modularity in javascript is also very helpful for allowing code to be cleaner and space efficient. In my opinion, the reuse of code allows the language to be ideal for software engineering.
