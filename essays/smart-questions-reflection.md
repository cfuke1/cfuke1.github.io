## What makes a Smart Question?

Eric Raymond uses many principles to ask correct questions. A few of these that I found to be most important were to make the question easy to reply to, written in clear grammatically correct and correctly-spelled language. Also, being explicit about one’s question stood out to me. I think that these are the most important principles to adhere to because they allow the question being asked to easily be answered by others online, and gives the question itself a higher chance to be answered by someone. People will naturally be drawn to the questions that are clear and concise, as it is easily understandable what the person asking wants. If the question is vague or hard to understand, then people would naturally be less inclined to answer, because it takes more time to decipher what the person actually wants. The quality of answers given should generally be better as well, because the reader is able to clearly see what the question is asking for. If the question is unclear, the answer given to the writer may be a solution to something they were not looking for. An example of what I would consider a smart question is this.

```
What are Null Pointer Exceptions (java.lang.NullPointerException) and what causes them?

What methods/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop the exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?
```

These questions are clear and concise, and also use proper grammar and spelling. It is obvious what the writer of the question is asking for, and it shows in the feedback that the question is given. There are 12 answers to this question on StackOverflow, providing the writer with more than enough information to find out what the Null Pointer Exception is, and how to avoid them. The question also follows many of the principles Eric Raymond emphasizes. It is easy to reply to, and written in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language. It also is explicit and precise about the problem the question is asking. This allowed the question being asked to be given a numerous amount of concise and clear responses. This question is a demonstration of good communication from a developer. Although the question is basic, and there are other easier ways of obtaining the answer to this question, because it follows what I believe to be the most important principles Raymond portrays, it is a good question to be asked. An example of a bad question is this.

```
I currently have a Sum Filter Formula that looks like the following:

=IFERROR(SUM(FILTER({$U$5:U;$W$5:W;$Y$5:Y;$AA$5:AA;$AC$5:AC;$AE$5:AE;$AG$5:AG;$AI$5:AI;$AK$5:AK;$AM$5:AM;$AO$5:AO;$AQ$5:AQ;$AS$5:AS;$AU$5:AU;$AW$5:AW;$AY$5:AY;$BA$5:BA;$BC$5:BC;$BE$5:BE;$BG$5:BG},{$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M;$M$5:M}=true,{$T$5:T;$V$5:V;$X$5:X;$Z$5:Z;$AB$5:AB;$AD$5:AD;$AF$5:AF;$AH$5:AH;$AJ$5:AJ;$AL$5:AL;$AN$5:AN;$AP$5:AP;$AR$5:AR;$AT$5:AT;$AV$5:AV;$AX$5:AX;$AZ$5:AZ;$BB$5:BB;$BD$5:BD;$BF$5:BF}=B5)),0)

Very gross I know, but I wanted to know if there was an easier way of writing this as it is very annoying to replicate for future uses and change when required.

Cheers in advance

This question violates many of the principles that Eric Raymond emphasizes. The question is hard to answer because it is very hard to look at and decipher. It is effectively just a big block of code. The text below also is very vague in what the writer is asking for. This violates many of Eric Raymond’s principles of a good question, some of which are being sent in a clear, standard format, making it easy to reply to, and being precise and informative about the problem. Aesthetically, the question is hard to look at, so people are also less inclined to give answers to it. This shows, as the question is downvoted on StackExchange, and has no answers. 

## Conclusion

Eric Raymond’s principles surrounding a question’s wording and precision are primarily responsible for making it a good question or not. The content of the question still does matter, but less than what makes it digestible for the reader. People are not required to give answers to these questions on websites like StackOverflow and StackExchange, so it is important to word questions in a way that is pleasant to look at. This means that large, hard to follow segments of code should be off limits if you want to write a good question. Vague and confusing wording should be avoided as well. Overall, you should be aiming to write a question that you would be willing to answer yourself if given the chance.
