International Students Association is an organization lead by students at the University of Manoa. It primarily focuses on supporting international students who transfer to UH Manoa. The organization helps to promote cultural exchange between foreign and local students. They also act as a support network amongst students for help with school. 

Joining International Students Association for me was a good way to meet new people and expand my social network. Branching out was good for me because I got to meet new people and understand new perspectives. It also helped me appreciate a lot of different cultures that I wasn't previously aware of. After being part of it for a while, I feel like my knowledge of different cultures and peoples has expanded greatly.
