summary: "Key Club is a community service oriented club from my high school."
---



Key Club is a club in Kailua High School that focused on community service. Every month, members were required to take part in one of their many projects dedicated to helping the school and community. Some of these that I was a part in were the beach trash cleanup, cleaning my school's zen garden, and the Kiwanis family dance. At these events, many students from my key club came to help make the local community a better place. 

Being part of Key Club was transformative for me because before it, I rarely ever took part in helping my community. It helped me learn more productive skills within volunteer work, and helped to establish core values within myself at a younger age. It also helped my collaboration and communication, because at all of the projects I attended, we were required to work with others.
