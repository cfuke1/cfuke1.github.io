The YMCA is an organization that gives back to the local community in a lot of ways. They have a gym, pool, classes, and offer winter and summer programs for children. They encourage their members to stay fit and active, and provide childcare to parents who need it.

I have both worked at the YMCA and done volunteer work for the YMCA. As a maintainence worker, I was tasked with keeping the facility clean, and ensuring that foliage stayed trimmed. Working there taught me that it is important to take part in things bigger than yourself, and that it is rewarding to help others as well.
