The UH Manoa Law Library 

I have both worked at the YMCA and done volunteer work for the YMCA. As a maintainence worker, I was tasked with keeping the facility clean, and ensuring that foliage stayed trimmed. Working there taught me that it is important to take part in things bigger than yourself, and that it is rewarding to help others as well.
