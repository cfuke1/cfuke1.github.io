The YMCA is an organization that gives back to the local community in a lot of ways. They have a gym, pool, classes, and offer winter and summer programs for children. They encourage their members to stay fit and active, and provide childcare to parents who need it. It was originally founded in 1844 in the United Kingdom, with the original goal to provide a supportive community for young men. Nowadays, the YMCA will acommodate anyone, and their goal is to serve their communities with caring, honesty, respect, and responsibility. 

I have both worked at the YMCA and done volunteer work for the YMCA. As a maintainence worker, I was tasked with keeping the facility clean, and ensuring that foliage stayed trimmed. Working there taught me that it is important to take part in things bigger than yourself, and that it is rewarding to help others as well. Also my position came with a lot of self-directed work. This allowed me to take initiative throughout my time working at the YMCA. It also greatly developed my initiative taking as a person.
